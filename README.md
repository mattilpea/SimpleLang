<h1>SimpleLang</h1>

<p><strong>A simple interpreted programming language made in C.</strong></p>

<p>It allows you to calculate the addition of two integer numbers.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>x = 5
y = x + 5
print y --> OUTPUT: 10
</code></pre>

<p>Most of the code itself is just string and user input checking honestly.</p>

<p>It was just a nice project for me to get started on trying to make my own programming languages. However, C doesn't seem to be the one for me yet, so I'll leave it at here and someday soon come back to make it all "high and mighty".</p>

# SimpleLang
A simple interpreted programming language made in C.
It allows you to calculate the addition of two integer numbers.
For example:
x = 5
y = x + 5
print y --> OUTPUT: 10
Most of the code itself is just string and user input checking honestly.
It was just a nice project for me to get started on trying to make my own programming languages however C doesnt seem to be the one for me yet so i'll leave it at here and someday soon come back to make it all "high and mighty".
